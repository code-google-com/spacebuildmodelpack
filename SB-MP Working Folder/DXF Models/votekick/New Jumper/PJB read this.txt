I have 3 textures for this jumper

Jumper_redone.dxf

First texture is the darker of the green textures, that goes on the outer part of the body.

Second, is the other green texture, which goes on the inside of the body, so its the interior texture, there are also gaps in the outer body which are intentional.

Third, is the floor texture, which will go on the floor of the jumper aswell as part of the door.



On the front and rear its a little different.

On the front, the darker texture goes around the windscreen and on the part that sticks out undernear the windscreen, which is just decoration.

On the rear the whole door and around it should be darker texture, and one side of the door, with a boarder there should be the flooring texture.




Sorry about you needing to lower the poly count again, but im pretty sure redoing it has made it easier to texture.
