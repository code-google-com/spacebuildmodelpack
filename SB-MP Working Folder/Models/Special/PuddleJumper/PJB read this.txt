
The jumper needs:
-A Collision Model
-To be roughly 40% bigger to fit though the new gates, thats easy I know.
-To be rounger, aparently its not round enough.(was thinking just make a cylinder, line it up witht he jumper and just use the top little bit, because all we really ne is the top bit to look round and the rest will just look rounder.
