# Cheesman52's orginal idea #
ere is my idea. Somebody could make a models pack with pre-built parts for ships. I'm not talking about a entire pre made ship I'm talking about the parts. We could have hall ways,pre built ship hulls with holes on the side so we can connect like other parts to main hull. I love space build but making a closed ship that looks good takes a while. This would cut time by alot and give more time for exploring. You could also have individual parts for like space stations. Could have a central p remade hub and have p remade hall ways to connect to other rooms. I don't know much about lag and stuff like that but I think these thing would reduce lag. Instead of having a bunch of props for a space station you could have as little as one. Please leave positive feedback. Sorry for bad spelling, my sister spill t juice on keyboard and now it all sticky.
Please give me gold stars if you like it please!

# Current Aims #
The idea is simple, but far reaching, a model pack, specifically (but not limited to) spacebuild.
The idea revolved around several sets of components that may be connected together to form a working (good looking) ship, with very little difficult, lag, or prop usage.

For example, I could spawn a pre-made ship hull, attach a bridge section, several mounts for engines, a couple of wings, put LS on it, add some thrusters and I've a working, original, and good looking ship.

Or for even more originality i could spawn some different parts of a hull, assemble a hull of the exact shape and size I required, construct some engine mounts from several more parts, and a bridge section from more, add some bays (cargo bay, bridge bay), then add thrusters LS (in said cargo bay) and I'd have again, a very simple, very good looking ship, that causes very very little lag compared to the same ship made from PHX (less props, and less complicated collisions)

Also Fighter hulls would be available, not to mention the myriad of bays, and even totally unoriginal pre-made ships!

# Our mission plan #
Possible Future Ideas:
Spawn 'panels' and auto-snap-together system for parts
Pressurization for specially codes water maps
A game-mode using the parts for ship construction based on a cost (global rp, but with only these parts)
Toolgun for spawning items

Medium Term plans:
Total premade ships (fully built ship ready to have LS and engines put on)
Premade Ship Hulls (internals not there, just the outside)
Around a hundred ship 'parts' including hull sections, wings, weapon mounts, engine sections, bridges, internal corridors, bays, etc.

Short Term Goal:
Basic ship parts in one style (three or so wing types, one set of corridors, a cargo and fighter bay, just enough parts to make a ship a few different ways)
Connection system based around 'pegs' (like lego almost)
